📘 Overview

This project implements a Linear Regression model wrapped inside a Scikit-Learn pipeline. It automatically preprocesses data using:

StandardScaler for numeric features

OneHotEncoder for categorical features

The model is then trained and evaluated using RMSE and R² Score. Several plots are generated to analyze price distribution and model performance.

⭐ Features

✔️ Automated preprocessing (scaling + encoding) ✔️ Train/test split for evaluation ✔️ Linear Regression model ✔️ Model performance metrics ✔️ Multiple visualizations ✔️ Fully reproducible workflow

📊 Dataset

The dataset used is:

House_Price_India.csv

Target variable: Price Inputs: Mixture of numeric and categorical housing attributes.

🧠 ML Pipeline

The pipeline consists of:

ColumnTransformer

Numeric → StandardScaler

Categorical → OneHotEncoder

⚙️ Installation

Install dependencies with:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

▶️ How to Run

Place the dataset House_Price_India.csv in the project folder.

Run the script:

python house_price_prediction.py

—or paste the code into a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab cell.

📈 Results

After training the model, the script prints:

RMSE – Indicates prediction error

R² Score – Indicates goodness of fit

Example:

RMSE: R² Score:
